Diagnosis is complex and requires assessment by a licensed professional. Without proper treatment and management, it can negatively impact many aspects of life including relationships, work, and, of course, mood. However, if you’ve been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, it does not have to define you. With the right support in place, you can live life to the fullest."

The tangles and the hair brushing are out of sight, out of mind. Sometimes they do this every day for many, many days.

So, if you find that you're tossing and turning, circle back to that first option and leave the bedroom entirely.",

It’s about accepting the moment rather than working on feeling better or telling yourself you shouldn’t feel that way. Accepting your pain can help you avoid suffering and can actually make you feel more optimistic about moving on."

Part of being human means that you need time to recharge and take the time to care for yourself. Self-care doesn’t just mean warm baths, spa days, or yoga — it also includes taking the time to balance your responsibilities and set boundaries. It can feel difficult to prioritize yourself, especially when you have others at work who are depending on you, but keep in mind that in order to work with and care for others effectively, it’s important to care for yourself first. When work stress builds up over time, it can be common to feel burnt out, disengaged, and frustrated. For caregivers, it can also be common to experience compassion fatigue, which is an inability to react sympathetically to a crisis or disaster due to overexposure."

One reason it can be so challenging to forgive yourself when you know you’ve done or said something wrong is that your mistake often doesn’t align with your values or intentions. Moving through the process of forgiveness, you may find that you lapse back into old feelings of anger and resentment. It’s normal to have those feelings. Part of what makes this a process is reminding yourself again and again that you are choosing forgiveness. The good news is that it’s possible to successfully forgive yourself."

If you can say to yourself, “this is a thought,” then you can also be aware that your thought isn’t necessarily reality or something you should identify with. Your thought is just passing across your mind’s awareness, kind of like weather passing across the sky. It might be raining right now, but you know it’s likely to be sunny again soon. Similarly, if you have a negative thought, then you can recognize that it’s just a thought and it’ll eventually leave to make room for another thought. The negative thought is just one of many types of thoughts that you’ll have in your lifetime."

You know that feeling you get when you’ve been on a boat and you finally get off of it and it still feels like the ground is moving? It can happen after a really long car ride sometimes too. Sitting down to meditate can sometimes feel like that. Just because you’ve sat down to meditate, it doesn’t mean that you won’t bring what you were already feeling to the table. If you were feeling restless when you sat down, you’ll probably still feel restless. And if you were already exhausted, you’ll feel that too."

What parts of you are itching to move? And if you’re exhausted, give your attention to that. Where do you feel the tiredness? Try to keep yourself engaged and aware of your exhaustion without giving in to it. If you find the practice physically painful, it’s OK to change how you’re sitting so that you’re as comfortable as possible. If that means lying down, lie down. Really, there’s no wrong way to meditate. You’re in the best position to become an expert on yourself and your well-being and how to make mindfulness work for you. The more you sit with awareness of what your body is feeling, the more you’ll recognize that just as your thoughts are passing influences, so are the physical sensations in your body. So, if you give the sensations your attention when they demand it, that’s a good thing. Just don’t identify yourself with the sensations. You are not the pain in your side. You are not the restlessness you’re feeling. Those are simply physical sensations that make up one part of your present moment."

When you close your eyes and intentionally recall the image of a loved one, you are practicing imagery. This is different than simply having a memory. The difference is that there’s intention behind practicing imagery. Sometimes when we think of memories, we are ruminating on the past about things that “could have” or “should have” gone differently. When we practice imagery, we are trying to bring up an image, feeling, or memory in a more positive way, to help us re-focus on what we want to cultivate more of in our lives (e.g., happiness, connection, acceptance).”"

Turn to calming imagery before stepping into an anxiety provoking situation, while feeling anxious, stressed, worried, or tense, and when decompressing from a stressful situation. Many people find that practicing calming imagery in the morning and at night as part of a daily routine helps them to be prepared to practice it when stressful or chaotic times arise, which can happen when least expected.",

                  "Fun fact: It’s great to practice calming imagery when you are actually feeling calm so that when the intense feelings of stress arise, you can more easily and quickly turn to doing calming imagery to bring you a sense of calm amidst the storm. When you know that a stressful situation is coming (for example, if you’re worried about meeting new friends, going to the doctor’s office, or driving in a car), calming imagery is a great way to calm your bodies and minds before stepping into a stressful situation."

Keep in mind that just struggling to use EFs doesn’t make you less intelligent or capable. Understanding how you pay attention and the intricate processes that are involved can help provide more insight into why it might be challenging sometimes to focus."

Research has also shown that it’s important to try and stick to a regular sleep schedule. So, for example, sleeping 10 hours on the weekend, but only 5 hours during weekdays means that on average you are still only getting an average of 6.4 hours of sleep per night. This type of sleep deprivation can add up over a long period of time if you are not mindful.

This is the most common reason people will drink and drive. They do not believe the alcohol has changed their ability to pay attention.

Read the statements you have written down several times or say them in your head.  After this, you may start to notice these thoughts the next time you go to drink or use other drugs.

How it's affecting the community, how the stigma and silencing can contribute and impact the mental health of those who identify with this. Touching a little bit more on the model minority myth and just going over some questions that we've prepared for each other. And then we're going to wrap up with some self care and the strengths that we can draw from our collectivist culture. Mili, am I missing anything else here?"

So AAPI month is a month where we pay tribute to the generations of Asian and Pacific Islanders who've enriched America's history and have just contributed to the success of this country. We celebrate it in May, it's a month long thing. And I think it's great that we're able to do this podcast and are able to touch on some of the things that actually affect the community. And there's so much diversity within the community itself. And it's wonderful to see how we can all come together and really talk about these things. And one of the things that I've seen come up when I was a coach was the messages around shame and vulnerability. So what do you think or how does shame contribute to messages around vulnerability and what do you think are some of the cultural tropes or stereotypes of normative or conforming behaviors that you feel you must violate to survive or thrive in a dominant culture?"

Most of our cultures, not every single one, but generally speaking, have this really collectivist idea, which I think tends to fight vulnerability. Because within collectivism, conformity tends to be what binds us and keeps us safe and secure in each of our family systems or cultural groups or communities. And I think that's often the part that's missed. Within each AAPI identity in and of itself, whether it's South Asian, whether it's East Asian or Southeast Asian or from the islands, there's so much diversity intra, within each community itself. So in order to keep that alive and well, I think there's this overarching system of shame that keeps us quiet, that kind of shuts down us sharing our individual experiences, particularly our emotions that are maybe more uncomfortable or may come across as being whiny or complaining or negative about our own culture, our own families, whatever the system is that we're in."

For those of us that aren't familiar, it speaks to this idea that Asian-American Pacific Islanders that traditionally inhabit space in the US have achieved a great deal, that they are very oriented towards success, usually determined by wealth or education, historically. So there's been this pressure, this idea from generation to generation to really thrive and to shine in those specific avenues. And I think that continues to feed a lot of the silencing that happens, because if we're supposed to be these models, we don't get to have problems and we don't get to complain about things. And there is this palpable sense of what can we do? How can we evolve and grow from there?"

And then I see my cousins and my friends, in my own generation, the next step, there is this shift towards seeing it as less of a blessing and more of a challenge or a curse and a difficulty to overcome, because it tends to separate us from our Black and Latin X and other minority group folks that we could be banding with to overcome and have frank discussions about some of the discrimination and challenges that we face here in the US. So the difference, as different as each of these communities is, I think we can have a shared experience of otherness, of really being minority and different. That's my long-winded answer to your question, but I think it also pulls to a follow-up from there."

So it was very, I guess, I wouldn't even say refreshing, just very validating to hear that. So I appreciate you sharing that experience, even the experience of your parents. To answer your question, “does silence honor cultural values?”, I think this is a tricky question and there's really no right or wrong answers. I feel like. I grew up in an Asian country where silence was equated to being polite. It means, this whole term, silence is golden. I remember that being taught to us when we went to school. You were supposed to show up through your actions rather than lots of noise or speaking up. Speaking up was deemed as rude or just disrespectful."

It was equated to respect and not shaming the person who has wronged you. So I feel like there are a lot of elements where we were constantly expected to take care of other people's feelings. And then this then contributes to further silencing of our pains or other issues that we may be experiencing. And when I think about it on a community level, it just makes me wonder how many of us grew up with that messaging. Like, you don't talk about your issues, you figure it out, you don't air your dirty laundry. You don't talk about the issues your family is going through because we were supposed to put up this front that we can manage things, that we can get through it and it should just be kept within the community. And I wonder too, did you experience something similar to that Mili?"

And even in talking to a lot of my East Asian friends (I identify as South Asian), and so in even those frank conversations, I've heard those kernels come through. This idea that if someone hurt your feelings or there was some sort of offense, even social grace or something deeper than that, that we don't call attention to that and we don't make them uncomfortable. There's so much ongoing shame around “don't call out something you see that's made you uncomfortable.” You deal with it yourself in your own way. And if there is any reason to talk about it, there's one usually designated member, whether it's of your family or of your community that you go to. And sometimes it's a religious leader, sometimes it's just an elder, someone who's older and wiser, and you work it out and you don't take it up directly."

The closest I can ever equate it to, I lived in Atlanta for a little while, is moving from the Northeast to the South. They say, “bless your heart” a lot in Atlanta. And I think to me, there was something very familiar about that because that's very similar to my experience of being South Asian, where there'd be underhanded messages of being really polite and saying something really formally in a way, but the underlying current is, “well, that was dumb, you've just made a huge gash, how dare you behave this way?” Really what it made me think of."

I like to really use, and again, this is from my own upbringing...there was such a tie in with religion and spirituality growing up for me. My family is actually South Indian Christians. It's a very specific subset of people, but that's the thing about being from a place like India. We're 2% of the Indian population, but there are a billion Indians. So they're actually quite a few of us out in the world. So one of the things that was really palpable for me growing up was how much support within the community there was."

And so they didn't have that tradition. So for me, when I think about self-care, there's this idea of community care, of connecting with, in this case, religion and spirituality, but also the cultural arc. So one of the things that I do at Christmas time is I make this rum cake that my granny used to make. It's of course, born out of the British Indian tradition, born out of this Christian tradition. There's so many things melding together, but it's not about making the rum cake, it's actually about taking it and bringing it to other people who wouldn't have it as part of their cultural identity."

So it was such an inclusive and warm way to use these festivals and traditions and this idea of culture in caring for myself and recognizing and celebrating my heritage and my traditions. Even recently, during this pandemic, I actually ended up making a really good friend in my building and she's Chinese American. And Chinese New Year came around and she invited me over to come to learn and make dumplings with her, which is obviously not something I knew how to do, but I do now. And they were so delicious and it was such a beautiful tie back and throwback to self care in the midst of all this COVID related loneliness and isolation."

It wasn't until I moved to the US that this term of self care, that was very focused on the individual, came about, at least for me, because I came from again, an Asian country, Malaysia, a very multiracial country. So when we see open houses in Malaysia, it often meant celebratory open houses, which means it's not like people are going to see a viewing of a house, it actually meant that when it's Diwali or Chinese New Year or Eid, folks are having open houses to have your neighbors over for food and drinks and just merriment and all that fun stuff. So it was always so nice to go around and hang out with folks. And so when I think about self care now...one of my forms of healthy coping, I found myself gravitating again towards community care. And that may even look like again, cooking something traditional, and then having my friends over or making a cup of chai in the evenings, just for me to have that space by myself."

I don't often speak Hindi, it's not a part of my vernacular, even regular part of my life now, but there's this feeling of deeper connection and resonance, because language, again, so much gets lost in translation. So when we think about caring for ourselves, as you were speaking, it really struck me, Shobana. It's so true. The idea of self care requires an identity of self, for so many of us, that's not even reachable, that's not an attainable concept. What do you mean by “self”? I am part of “we”, this is how it is. So it's just a really interesting frame, and I think it brings it back to this idea of what are some cultural expectations that interfere with self care, that really get in the way.

                "text": "Wow, great question. Like I was saying earlier, this concept of self care came about recently when I first moved to the US. Because a lot of the AAPI values, at least from what I've observed in my own experience, are aligned with self sacrifice and doing what's best for others and for the collective good. So the concept of self-care is still a foreign term, especially for a lot of older AAPI folks. Like when I talk about self-care to my parents, they are so lost because there's a lot of internalized messages around rest and relaxation. Taking care of yourself may even come across as selfish, especially when it doesn't centralize others. So given the rich history of immigration within the community, a lot of them had to work hard. And as you mentioned already about the model minority myth, it can be so challenging to separate the self from constantly doing, from constantly achieving, from constantly performing."

But one of the things that I find, and this is, I would say, maybe a part of me that's radicalized, just reminding myself that self-care and getting rest and taking care of myself allows me to be more present. And that itself has fundamentally changed how I view care in general. And it helped me separate some of these long held associations I've had around rest and guilt. And I think it is something that the community can come together towards. So just encouraging folks. And we see our parents working hard. And it's one of those things of just reminding them, it's okay to put yourself first."

I mean, I think the closest I am often able to arrive at this space is when we think about values that are held within our culture around things like meditation, for example. I think there are a few pockets of aloneness and self-reflection that are very much encouraged within our communities, but it gets lost along the way as we get really driven by achievements and as our roles multiply. And when you're younger and in your own space with just your peer groups, and then you start forming families of your own creation, and then there are more demands from family of origin, that creates all of these nested relationships. Which again, it is about the self because we are connecting to, but then it so quickly becomes about the other because we're so used to mirroring and turning the frame around culturally."

I'm going to party.” I'm not going anywhere, it's a Tuesday, but I did that in order to just get some relaxation and feel really just calm and soothed and also a little bit pampered. That's the other thing, I think you and I offline have chatted about this before, we get so caught up in “it always has to cost money” or “it has to be something that's going to take away from something else.” Often it's as simple as just whether it's chai, whether it's that hot cup of steaming coffee, whatever it is, giving yourself this space for five minutes, 15 minutes (it doesn't have to be a ton of time) that's just your own."

And it's so welcome and it's so hospitable, just the hospitality that's a part of our cultural network.

I was on the precipice of graduating from college and I was like, “What do you do with a degree in psychology?” I had no clue, so in my mind, I was like, “Well I have no clue, so I might as well just go to grad school. Just keep going to school.” Well when you apply to grad school, you have to write a personal statement about what you want to do research on. Given that I applied to grad school and was thinking about my research many, many years ago, the time in which I was applying, it didn't really feel safe to say I wanted to do LGBTQ research. So I actually, in my personal statement, said I wanted to do research on black single mothers and parent-child dynamics, which I was absolutely definitely interested in, but I knew it wasn't what I really wanted. But I needed it in and I didn't want my desire to study LGBTQ folks to be the reason I didn't get into grad school."

I think that people can freely write about wanting to do LGBTQ research and it be welcomed. I think that for me, realizing that I couldn't write about that freely made me consider the fact that maybe I did need to be doing the work anyway. I think that once I got to grad school, like I said, there just wasn't enough research out there. I would write papers in grad school about LGBTQ issues, particularly as it pertained to the intersection of blackness. I could read books by Audre Lorde and I could read books by other people at the intersection of queerness and blackness. There weren't that many of those, most of it was like urban fiction if we did want to read that. But there just wasn't as much academic research."

I didn't understand that I was either. I mean I came from a very religious family, so when I did begin to understand what that meant, what that questioning meant, of course there was a lot of resistance and pushback to it, although I really enjoyed holding hands with my friends who were girls. So it really was an interesting kind of experience growing up and not knowing that what you like is different, and then having to come to that over many, many years of denial or social oppression or whatever the case might be, just figuring it out. Plus young people don't know what they want anyway when they're 13, 16, barely 20, barely know what they want, and I think a lot of that also got me thinking about the importance of identity development. That we have to support young people as they are exploring their identities and what can we learn from them also. What knowledge do they already have that can contribute to us supporting others in their well-being?"

You just need God or whatever.” I think that for many LGBTQ folks, that's increasingly difficult when the religious rhetoric is actually oppressive to them. So how can one who's navigating their sexual identity feel safe to pray or talk to someone who they feel is going to oppress them? So yeah, I definitely did not have the support. I think that my parents also didn't know how to navigate it. They did more harm than they did good, and I think that there are so many ways that parents and community members can support young LGBTQ folks better. I'm trying to find the right words. Because I don't want to say my parents were bad parents, they were definitely great parents, but there were things that they didn't know and I think that there are ways in which they needed to grow also and things that they needed to shift.

It's a matter of us checking them when we do realize we have them, and I was actually a little surprised by the results. So before I kind of talk about the results, I think that there's this notion in this country that people cannot be queer and religious. Like those two identities are often pitted against each other on polar opposite ends. But for black people, who are the most religious group in this country, you cannot necessarily separate them from their religious identity even when they are queer."

Black people are raised in the church, so their religion becomes very much a part of their community, a part of how they view the world, a part of how they view themselves. For many they develop their sexual identity along the same time as they're developing their religious and their racial identities. For some people the development of their sexual identity comes a bit later. But regardless of that timeframe, those identities are still all going to be there with that person as they continue to age, and so in my mind, I'm like, “Okay, I know religion has a lot of positive attributes and there's so much research on what religion does to someone's mental health and well-being.” It has shown through and through to be a positive resource for folks. But I also know that it can also do harm to people who are LGBTQ and so I wanted to explore that dynamic some more."

You won't have as much resilience.” But that wasn't the case. What we found is that for folks who had higher levels of internalized homonegativity, which basically means they had more negative feelings about themselves because of their sexual identity, and who were also high on religious faith had the most resilience.

We don't know if they no longer are part of a church, if they're still in a church. So there are some details that we weren't able to really articulate fully. Those are things that must continue to be explored with future research.

So I articulate negative religious rhetoric as the words that churches use to condemn and oppress LGBTQ people through religious texts or religious beliefs, and a lot of them just talk about how when they read the Bible, they see love. God is love. But that's not what the church is saying, right? The church then says something different, and that was a discord for them.

So my mom was a cosmetologist and so I always spent a lot of time with her and so I grew up in that community which is like black women space. And then I also grew up in the church, which was a predominantly black church. So I grew up in that black space. But my parents also moved us to a city where I was the only black kid in class.

I didn't grow up queer, and by the time I was adult age, 18, I did realize, like I said, that there was this LGBTQ community, and that's when the exploration and the fun and the parties ... In those days, it was very wholesome. Like I don't know, it was just very ... I don't know what it's like now. I mean there's nothing now I guess because of COVID but -"

But I also learned very quickly about the limited expectations too about gender and gender roles in the LGBTQ community that I think a lot of people don't talk about. I think there's a particular expectation for people assigned female at birth, for people assigned male at birth, for how they're supposed to engage or not engage within the LGBTQ community depending on their gender presentation. So I learned a lot of lessons I think as a young 19-year-old and had to make my own kind of decisions about how I fit or didn't fit within those spaces."

How are you all enacting laws that are not going to support these young people as they get older? How are you continuing to oppress them through your microaggressions and your microassaults?

Similarly for trans youth. I mean trans folks have existed since the beginning of time. Colonization made us forget that, and so I think that we also need to stop pathologizing trans youth and making trans youth feel like they're not old enough to make informed decisions about their gender identity because we know that by age three through research that children are very clear about their gender identity, and that research has been consistent and persistent for decades."

But as more awareness comes, there are opportunities for people to support one another but then I just can't imagine what it's like for trans kids these days with all these bills, you can't play in sports, you can't do this. So there's just that awkward thing that happens all the time when people are fighting for their rights and when people are becoming recognized, where it's just like, “Okay, recognition is needed,” and then all of a sudden boom, here, okay, let's find legislation or let's find a way to put a cap on this and not actually allow it to happen. So the more you're aware of your ability to express yourself a little bit more, the more that you're recognized a little bit more, then comes even more challenges.

When you live in San Francisco, when you live in New York, when you live in other “progressive” cities, you're more likely to see these spaces be created because it feels safer to do so. Unfortunately, where we are now in 2021, nowhere is really safe. Like you said, there's so much legislation happening that's trying to continue to marginalize these young folks. But I think that one of the strongholds of the LGBTQ community and the black community has always been working together. Coming together, telling stories, laughing together, being in community with each other. I think that is how we've thrived over all these years. Even if we just think about how pride even started, like this whole idea of the cafeteria riots in the city in Stonewall in New York, those happened because a bunch of people were already hanging out, partying, having fun, and then they were tired of the oppression, so they responded."

I don't really think that there's any place in the United States where you can talk freely about mental health without somebody making a statement that's problematic, pathologizing. So I think we need to do better as a country in general with dismantling mental health stigma. Making mental health more accessible. Making mental health covered by insurance, right? Like there's just so many things that we can do as a country to make mental health normalized so that people can have these conversations freely and not feel strange or oppressed because they want to share their truth with their friends, with their parents, with their aunts, with whoever, with their partner."

So I'm not a therapist, so let me preface all of this by saying I am not a therapist, I am a researcher. But I do know that there are some folks who finish their entire degrees and never take a class on LGBTQ issues.

That is something that is huge, and that's something that needs to be worked on.

I am about to start a research study that explores identity development for non-binary and gender-expansive people assigned female at birth. Again, I always try to do research on groups that are ignored within the academy, within the field of research. A lot of research finding is always about pathology and I don't do that. So I am looking to understand how non-binary and gender-expansive people come to that. Like how do you get to that place when the world is so binary? How are you able to deconstruct that and to live freely in a world that wants to put you in a very small broken box? And what language are you using to describe your identities, what pronouns are you using? Is there consistency across race on the pronouns used for non-binary folks? Just really kind of exploring the experiences of those who no one really cares to explore."

But I think that the current language around non-binary folks, there's so much more of it now than there ever has been in the past, and I think that we need to think about how we can support these folks in therapy, in schools, government records. Like all kinds of things, there's just so many ways that we need to make sure we're doing this right and we're not continuing to perpetuate more harm."

Like explore your gender, explore all of that stuff. Tell me what your personal pronoun is. Like I want to know that stuff”, and there are some people that are in my age group and queer folks too or just or like older queer folks who are like, “I don't want to say they. What is they? I don't understand what that is.” And it's like, “Well how are we supposed to support our kids if we're not ... Or how are we supposed to be good elders if we're not going to respect what their personal pronouns are and not try to understand what that experience is like for them.” Like it might have been different for us, but that's a big thing."

I think that pride has become commodified and capitalism has thoroughly ruined it. Pride was a revolt. Pride was a stance against oppression, started by a black transwoman and a Latinx transwoman. Let us never forget that history, and I think that now, Pride is just companies putting up a rainbow flag in June and taking it down July 1 and I think that we need to really think about what Pride means to us and how can we make sure that Pride really is rooted in the history of the very first Pride. I think in an ideal world for me, Pride would continue to be resistance. Pride would be liberation. Pride would be safety and Pride would be inclusive of all folks. Inclusive of trans folks, inclusive of queer folks of color, inclusive of queer folks who may be living with a disability. I think that we don't have enough conversations about our deaf queer folks, our queer folks living on the spectrum. Like we just don't talk about it enough and they exist. So I think pride needs to be just more. It needs to be more expansive. Just like we just need to break all the limited binaries and expectations and really get back to the root of fighting for justice."

When that happens and you can no longer have a productive conversation, call for a break. If you are the one asking for the break, it is on you to set the terms of that break. You determine how long the break will be and are responsible for re-initiating the conversation after the break ends. During the break time, you both have a responsibility to the other to self soothe. For example, you might decide you need a 30-minute break from a discussion.  Over those 30 minutes you might take a shower, listen to music you love, or do something else to help you feel calm again. At the end of that period (consider setting a timer!), go find your loved one and ask them if they are ready to continue the conversation."

                  "The brain to believe in the worst outcomes. For example, someone with anxiety may worry about a disaster that is statistically unlikely to occur. It can be scary for the person to believe that the future will bring hurt, fear, and pain, but those worried thoughts, however, don’t always respond to rational arguments. For most people with anxiety, especially children, it is not helpful to simply command them to “Stop Worrying.” Instead, tell them you understand why they are worried and encourage them to distract themselves with more positive thoughts and activities. Use a grounding technique to keep their mind focused on the present instead of the future. Remind them that they are strong and can handle anything that comes their way. Point out past worries and how they successfully survived the worrying situation. With a sympathetic tone, you can share that their irrational fear is unlikely to occur.",
                  "High self-criticism. It may not be only the unpredictable future your child is worrying about, they may also be worried about the past. Your child’s mind may fixate on anything they have said or done in the past. They may be overwhelmed with the worry that they have made a catastrophic mistake. That slip-up three years ago when they mispronounced a word in front of their classmates... That one moment may continue to weave it’s way into their anxious minds and cause them to want to change their name and switch schools. Your anxious child likely has a habit of reliving their most humiliating life experiences, and wanting desperately to AVOID future mistakes. Similar to how you can distract them from worrying about the future, use similar grounding and distraction techniques to focus on the here and now.",
                  "Physical symptoms. Your anxious child may complain about stomach aches, headaches, chest pain, dizziness, and many other physical ailments. Always make sure any medical conditions your child has are checked out by a professional. If a medical professional does not believe there is a medical reason for their physical complaints, it could be that somatization (expressing a mental issue with a physical symptom) is the root cause. For example, a fast heart rate and high blood pressure may be solely caused by experiencing anxiety. What’s worse, sometimes somatic symptoms worsen when a person with anxiety becomes even more worried that they are sick. It’s important to find a balance between following up on health concerns while also not running to the doctor for every somatic complaint from a healthy child. If possible, have the medical professional talk to the mental health professional so your child has a team that’s aware of what’s going on and can collaborate on care.",
                  "Your child asks a lot of questions. Anything they don’t feel certain about is a potential area for a disaster to occur, and therefore a source of worrying. It is OK not to be able to answer every question, either because you don’t have the answers or you don’t have the time. Maybe you are in the middle of cooking dinner and you can’t address a never-ending flood of questions. Respond calmly that you don’t have an answer or that you aren’t able to focus on that issue at the moment but you will give your child your full attention at another time. Try to find set times to spend talking with your child so you can redirect their questions to the next set time you will be available for them.",
                  "Low frustration tolerance & controlling behavior. Your child’s anxiety is taking up a lot of their mental and emotional energy. On a good day they may be able to manage some minor frustrations, but if they are already anxious, the slightest inconvenience or mishap in their day could become a massive explosion. This is often displaced anger, or taking stress out on a problem they can seek to control because they aren’t able to resolve the true problem that is causing them stress. Seek out opportunities to help your child feel in control again by giving options when possible, offering choices, and following their lead on a reasonable request.",
                  "Restlessness & sensory overload. Shaking legs, fidgeting hands, and an overall inability to sit still can be signs that your child is experiencing anxiety. The fast heart rate caused by anxiety’s physical symptoms combined with racing disastrous thoughts and fears could lead to an energy overload. Restlessness can best be managed with physical exercise to burn off energy, relaxation to reduce tension, or sensory stimulation to take back control over the senses. Suggest your child splash cold water on their face, turn music on, rip up some old papers, massage their hands with a scented lotion, or use a weighted blanket to create strong sensory experiences. You may need to find a quiet setting with fewer sensory distractions for your child to fully regain control over their sensory system. Note that some children seeking sensory stimulation to redirect their energy may engage in unhealthy behaviors such as hitting or harming themselves, overeating, or breaking items."

A therapist may want to use exposure techniques to support your child in developing coping abilities to overcome their phobia",

Panic attacks manifest very physically and may include a faster heartbeat, racing thoughts, difficulty breathing, chest pain, blurry vision, excessive sweating, crying, shaking, or rapid body temperature changes. It’s quite common that people who are having a panic attack think they are having a heart attack until a medical provider clarifies they are medically stable. Sometimes kids try to avoid situations where they fear having a panic attack. It’s helpful to have an exit strategy in those places so your child does not feel trapped"

                  "Emotional changes: Even with depression, you may still see your child happy. Your child will still laugh, smile, and experience joyful moments. This does not mean they are no longer struggling with depression. Most likely, your child’s high, or joyful, moments are a little less joyful than they used to be and their low, or sad, moments are more down than they used to be.",
                  "Distorted thinking: When people are depressed, they sometimes have distorted thoughts that tell them they are unloved, a burden, and useless. Your child will need many reminders that they are loved, strong, and deserving of affection. Your child will be quick to pick up on any impatience in your tone so make sure to practice your own relaxation techniques to keep yourself calm",
                  "Irritability: Your child may see someone in the family with a positive attitude and feel an urge to react or lash out at that person’s mood. Let your child know you understand they are having a bad day and offer to help them. But also remind them of household rules and enforce consequences if they have acted inappropriately toward another family member. For some teens, depression looks like anger; you may not see them cry or appear sad. Make sure you are making more positive statements than corrective statements to your child. If you can’t find things to praise them for, you may benefit from some self-care for yourself (check out other activities in the Self-Care Library for more resources or reach out to your coach for help). We know you deeply love your kid — even if there are days you don’t like being around them.",
                  "Exhaustion: If you notice their homework piling up, their bedroom floor disappearing under a growing mess, or an odor telling you they probably haven't bathed recently, it may be that these tasks feel overwhelming to your teen and they don’t have the energy to do them. They may even feel like a failure for not being able to complete these tasks. Help your child break down tasks into small, manageable steps. Celebrate each step to build back a sense of competence and achievement. And offer to help (even if you believe your child should be capable of doing this independently). It may encourage your teen to get moving if everyone in the family is working together. Try putting on some music and cleaning up as a family!",
                  "Isolation: You might notice your child is not spending time with friends anymore. Be curious and ask if there are any plans they want to make with their peers. It’s possible your child is having distorted thoughts, and is thinking their friends don’t care about them anymore. Suggest that they invite a friend over for a popcorn and movie night. You may also see your child want to spend more time alone in their bedroom. It’s important for them to have a private space, but if they are left alone with their depression too long, their mood may only get worse. Don’t force them out! Instead, invite them out for a special one-on-one activity that you believe they would enjoy. (Pro tip: While you’re in the car with your teen, casually ask your child how they are doing. The absence of eye contact during car conversations can sometimes be the change they need to open up to you."

Generally, your child’s mental health needs will be met with the support of their coach and/or their therapist. If your child needs additional clinical support within the Headspace Care platform, your child’s therapist will reach out to explore the possibility of making a referral to a psychiatrist. Clinicians (in other words, therapists and psychiatrists) provide care through scheduled video sessions. Coaches, therapists, and psychiatrists make up your child’s care team and work together to provide seamless care so your child can pick up right where they left off with each provider."

Consider journaling, taking a mindfulness break such as a walk or some deep breathing, or reaching out to support groups, family, and friends for emotional support.

In a relationship where gaslighting is prevalent, there will be a gaslighter (perpetrator) and a gaslightee (victim). At the core, the gaslighter works to undermine and/or discredit the gaslightee. They may try to do this in hidden or direct ways with the ultimate goal of making the gaslightee lose their sense of reality and question themselves. At first the gaslightee may find themselves in disbelief about what they are feeling and later become defensive. The defensiveness can become very exhausting and can lead to a sense of powerlessness, hopelessness, and depression."

I often ask folks, what are some of the myths and messages that you got around relationships? I ask them to take a second and think about, what were you taught about what makes a relationship great, good, acceptable? Can you think of things that you were told that were explicit things, that would just pop in your mind when I say that?"

Also a sense of playfulness and fondness and intimacy and sexuality, if it's an intimate relationship, obviously, is different, as much as you want or as little as you want. All of these take work. Most relationships are most likely a combination of both healthy and unhealthy characteristics. We're all learning and people aren't perfect and everybody has their issues and the relationships need to be maintained. Healthy relationships take work to be really conscious about how people are treating each other. This applies to all relationships, work relationships, friendships, family, romantic."

How do you feel in this relationship? We could talk about what's going on and this person did this and I didn't do that and they did this and there was this thing and then they said this and they talked to... It could be all of this stuff. But the whole object of relating is considering yourself and another person or persons at the same time. It's something that takes a lot of awareness.

Many people have been in or witnessed relationships where conflict was extremely unhealthy, toxic, and destructive.

So those three skills that we discussed in podcast number two can apply them to your relationships and see what relationships can be nurtured and can be expanded on and that are, if the other people, persons, or people or persons are able to meet you halfway and to work on that with you, that's a healthy relationship.

If you want to expand your social circle, just know that connecting with other people is something that we learn to do along the lifespan and it shifts and it changes. Focusing on having healthy relationships is as worthwhile and as important as a healthy diet, as moving, as stimulating yourself intellectually and spiritually and everything.

Taking time to reflect on the origin of your body narrative can help you begin to unravel beliefs that might not be serving you anymore. Ask yourself, “At what age did I start having concerns about my body?” “How did the stories I used to tell myself impact my life at the time?” Recognizing how these patterns formed in your mind is an important step. Once you’re clear, you can start to undo patterns that you’ve held onto from a young age.",

Rather than thinking of food as either healthy or unhealthy, which can make you feel guilty and lead to a strained relationship with food, intuitive eating integrates instinct, emotion, and rational thought into food choices. Reminding yourself you’re allowed to feel pleasure through eating can help you adopt a more neutral and kind outlook on food choices.",

It is valid to question these entrenched eating beliefs and give yourself the compassion you deserve."

One of the biggest benefits of mindful parenting is learning to manage your emotions and modeling that for your children. In times of distress, being mindful may seem unrealistic, but with a little practice, mindfulness is achievable, even in the most stressful circumstances. Below are three tactical ways to practice mindful parenting:"

                  "Practice Conscious awareness: Mindful parenting may look like bringing conscious awareness to the current situation instead of letting your emotions hijack the situation. For example, imagine that your three-year-old is throwing a tantrum at the dinner table and refusing to eat their vegetables. In this situation, you might acknowledge that when your child throws a tantrum, it is really frustrating. Naming the emotion allows you to pause and acknowledge what's currently happening.",
                  "Let go of guilt and shame: Mindful parenting can include letting go of guilt and shame about the past, and focusing on the present. For example, perhaps you’re feeling guilty about having to travel for work and being away from your children. In this situation, you might experience feelings of guilt. That's OK. Instead of trying to change or avoid those feelings, practice acceptance.",
                  "Pause before responding: Mindful parenting teaches us how to pause before responding. For example, instead of lashing out in anger and frustration when your child is upset, mindful parenting might mean taking five minutes to practice deep breathing or affirmations to get through the tough moment. Taking this moment to pause can help you choose the best way to respond to your child’s behavior."

The difference is if you were inside or outside your window of tolerance. Staying inside your window of tolerance can help you be more resilient and deal with difficulties.

Employees with these personal experiences were engaged in their work. Some even felt their career choice was a calling."

But, as we learned from the insurance industry study, building engagement with what you’re doing is the best approach to preventing burnout. Deriving meaning from and feeling personally invested in what you do can help you cope with challenges and more quickly recover from stress. While a career change may be possible for some people, it’s unrealistic for others. You don’t have to change jobs to find something you can engage with; you might just need to change how you think about it."

On top of that, she’s seen some coworkers laid off recently and she’s worried about her job. In this story, you realize your friend said she took her mother to the doctor on Monday, which might be why she wasn’t able to get back to you until Tuesday. And, when you think about it, you realize that she might be worried about losing her job and so she might be trying to take shorter lunches, which might explain why she was late.
